Through various mentors and friends that I have networked and made over the years, I have gained great insight into their fields of expertise. They have pointed me towards various enriching opportunities I otherwise would never experience. Such as joining the science Olympics team, competing in various contests, and volunteering for the school's head of science department.","I am not a very demanding person; I am not very comfortable with confrontations, or making requests and bothering other people. During grade 10, I requested to study physics at the grade 12 level when I became a grade 11 student; the guidance counselor agreed after weeks of negotiation. However, an issue with the registration system has failed to enroll me in that class. When I realized this mistake, I went out of my way to try to alter my schedule. When I received the news that the class was already full, a part of me was ready to give up. However, after much self-reflection, I decided to try again. I visit my guidance counselor everyday asking if any spots has opened up, and on the last day of the available window for switching classes, one spot opened up. I rushed to the guidance office and got the class. It was a very stressful week, and I realized that how easy it was for me to simply give up during that week, but, ultimately, it was my determination that let to its success.",,2,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,3,2,"Academic Clubs (design teams, consulting, data science, finance etc), Athletics (varsity team, intramural, personal fitness etc.), Artistic (music, dance, theater, visual arts, design etc.), Humanitarian (service clubs, volunteering, social justice etc.), Part-time Employment, Greek Life","Staying in and relaxing, Studying, Getting together with a small group of friends","Mushrooms, Sausage",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,make friends,Male,he/him/his,Straight,Asian - East Asian,No,,

The beginning was certainly very bumpy, but it didn't take long for me to develop a love for writing memoirs. I was very anxious at first to share my writing with the class, but soon embraced the feeling of vulnerability and authorship. I kept writing memoirs and short stories as the school year went by, unaware of how invested I had become.

Our lesson was about motor learning and we were to demonstrate this science through the skill of juggling. Throughout the class, I quickly realized how terrible my sense of balance and hand-eye coordination was. Although I could barely throw a ball to the other hand, I was determined to learn how.

That evening, I grabbed some tennis balls I had lying around and started by watching youtube tutorials. My mom soon picked up what I was trying to do and started to learn with me. We were able to motivate each other throughout the process and provide feedback on what we were doing wrong.

Being put into a completely new environment upon my very first class, I found it difficult to socialize with others and the thought of presenting a project in front of my class terrified me.

This all changed when I attended the SHAD program in the summer of 2018.

I realized how simple it was to speak up and with the encouragement of my peers throughout my every endeavor, I started to become more confident with myself.

I started by filling my Instagram feed with dance accounts - providing inspiration and giving me more exposure to the world of dance. I also joined UW Hip Hop for their drop-in lessons. In doing so, I discovered a community passionate about dancing whom I could ask questions to. During drop-in sessions, I would ask people around me for feedback and tips, allowing me to make the most of the session. By reaching out to people around me, I learned much faster. ","I stepped out of my comfort zone when I was the driver for my family RV trip, driving 4 hours to Tobermory. I hadn't ever driven this long, but the rest of my family needed me to step up to the challenge. There were times during the ride when I was intimidated by the poor handling of the vehicle and when there was poor visibility at night. I'm thankful that everything went smoothly. Looking at the bigger picture, I learned that to get somewhere in life, you just have to trust the process and drive one mile at a time.

One of these things was doing a cultural dance in front of my entire school. I was extremely nervous before we started, but once we got into it, I realized how much fun it was to not care about what other people thought about you. Everyone in the audience loved it and I realized that there was nothing to be scared of because I know that if I were the one in the crowd, I would be appreciating the dance, not scrutinizing every little thing like I always think people are doing.

I consulted with academic advisor on which courses to take but it was not as helpful as I thought it would be because there are too many to choose from. Moreover, the courses required for my degree were not available, so I thought why not to take a language course. I decided to take GER101 because of some historical reasons. 
I could never expect that I can be so in love with learning an absolutely new thing.

I did not hesitate to accept the invitation since I had to find something to do during my summer break.

Each time I arrived on campus, I had the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge research. Even better was that I got to meet researchers, professors, and like-minded peers, eventually striking an email correspondence with a PhD student guest speaker. Nonetheless, the person who supported me the most throughout these exploits was my IB physics teacher and science Olympiad coach. After every session, I would rush into his room at 7:45 AM the next morning and gush about what I had gleaned the prior night. With a smile on his face, he would then offer his own insights. Those mornings were my fondest memories of high school. Through Tech+, I hope to meet a mentor who I can share similar feelings of excitement with and who can open my eyes to new aspects of industry. ","Before joining one of five jazz ensembles offered at my new school, I had only the slimmest notions of what jazz was. Typically outgoing and bubbly, my inexperience stifled me in the band room. Near the end of the year, I mustered the courage to volunteer for a short improvised solo at annual music gala. I wanted to prove that a late start wouldn't hinder me from taking new risks. When the night finally arrived,  I stared into the crowd as the anticipation climaxed and my band mates crooned along. I lifted my horn to my lips and the 32 bars were over in an instant. The rest of the evening was awash in a warm glow of accomplishment and the thought that ""*Hey, that wasn't too bad at all*.""

To make matter worse, I was leading the project and I took large portions of responsibility. At first, I was worried about making mistakes, however, I found myself enjoying the extra responsibility.

I got to learn that if you never try something you never know if you might enjoy it so definitely take a shot at it.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek248/,0,3,1,0,3,0,2,3,3,1,1,"Academic Clubs (design teams, consulting, data science, finance etc)",Staying in and relaxing,"Bell Peppers, Olives",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,,,he/him/his,,,,,

I was always an artist since elementary school and although I was good at drawing. My passion for computers and attempting something artistic with it brought me to photoshop. I didn‚Äôt really have anyone around me to teach me anything about photoshop so youtube became my best friend. That was the primary resource where I tried to learn everything I know now about Photoshop.","One time that I went outside of my comfort zone, it was not related to my career or school. It was when I first started running. Although I was active as a kid, I never knew running would be so much fun to me. At my school, I joined my cross country team in grade 3 and have done it all the way through middle and high school! It was not something that I was used to, running 5-6km at a time was super difficult but it taught me patience and control. Joining the cross country team helped me meet so many new people and develop my social skills to the point where I am comfortable talking to anyone new I meet.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedant101/,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,"Academic Clubs (design teams, consulting, data science, finance etc), Athletics (varsity team, intramural, personal fitness etc.), Artistic (music, dance, theater, visual arts, design etc.), Part-time Employment","Staying in and relaxing, Getting together with a small group of friends","Pineapple, Extra Cheese",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Anything that will allow me to help me with my career in design!

After coming across multiple videos showcasing the culinary scene and food-centric culture of Korea, I became interested in learning more about the Korean culture and language. Initially I was driven by my desire to visit Korea one day, but after learning the basics of the alphabet (Hangeul), I found myself wanting to become fluent in the language. During my learning journey, I‚Äôve utilized numerous resources to familiarize myself with the culture - from YouTube videos to daily Duolingo lessons. Lately, I‚Äôve even begun watching variety shows and Korean dramas to gain exposure to Korean conversations. These resources have been tremendously helpful in guiding me in my Korean studies.","This past summer, I built my first full-stack project - a mobile app launched on the Google Play store. It was my first time building a project of this scale and I was daunted by the technologies and concepts that I didn‚Äôt understand. However, I had always been interested in the idea of creating mobile apps, which motivated me to try something new. At first, I struggled to grasp the tools and ideas I needed to piece the project together. I was overwhelmed by the amount of information that was available, filled with technical jargon and concepts that I had never encountered before. Slowly, I learned that the first few steps are the hardest, but they lay an important foundation for overcoming new challenges and solving problems. Throughout the process, I found a new passion for building useful and meaningful apps.","https://www.linkedin.com/in/philips-xu/, https://github.com/Puepis",0,1,0,2,0,0,1,3,3,2,3,"Academic Clubs (design teams, consulting, data science, finance etc)",Getting together with a small group of friends,"Pineapple, Ham",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,"Food across the world, cooking, side projects, how to learn efficiently",Male,he/him/his,Straight,Asian - East Asian,No,,
