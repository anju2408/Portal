# Tech+ UW Portal

## About
The Tech+ UW Portal is the main landing site for current/prospective members and sponsors to learn about Tech+. Moreover, this portal also enables mentors and mentees to update their profiles and potentially maintain mentor-mentee relationships.

## Running the Server-Side API
The server-side API is a **dockerized** application, hence you will need the following installations on your machine: 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

The API can then be run by running the following commands on your terminal: 
```shell
cd server
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
